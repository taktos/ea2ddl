# identityDefinitionMap: (Default 'map:{}')
# 
# The relation mappings between identity and column of table.
# Basically you don't need this property because DBFlute
# can get the information about identity from JDBC automatically.
# The table names and column names are treated as case insensitive.
# 
# Example:
# map:{
#     ; PURCHASE     = PURCHASE_ID
#     ; MEMBER       = MEMBER_ID
#     ; MEMBER_LOGIN = MEMBER_LOGIN_ID
#     ; PRODUCT      = PRODUCT_ID
# }
#
# *The line that starts with '#' means comment-out.
#
map:{
    #; PURCHASE     = PURCHASE_ID
    #; MEMBER       = MEMBER_ID
    #; MEMBER_LOGIN = MEMBER_LOGIN_ID
    #; PRODUCT      = PRODUCT_ID
}
